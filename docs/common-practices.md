Common Practices
================

Code Style
----------
* Install the IntelliJ [code style] and [inspections]. Format the source code with these settings in our own projects. Resolve the warnings
  indicated by the inspections.
* In Dataverse try to minimize code changes due to reformatting, so only apply formatting to code that you have changed anyway.
